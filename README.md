AtliQ is a hardware company specializing in products like PCs, mouse, printers, and more. It operates through two customer platforms: brick-and-mortar stores, such as Chroma and Best Buy, and e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. Both platforms fall under the Retailer channel. Additionally, AtliQ owns its own stores, including AtliQ-e-store and AtliQ-exclusive, which operate under the Direct channel. Furthermore, AtliQ utilizes distributors in other countries, such as Neptune in China, to navigate regulatory constraints. With access to AtliQ's hardware data, I developed several insightful reports tailored to their needs.
